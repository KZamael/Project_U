# Project_U
## Student Project, using Thymeleaf and Javalin.

This App is made for the "Internet-Programming" course.
Made by Javalin as the Web-Framework for Server Administration and Thymeleaf for rendering.

Uses Guava as Coreframework, Mindrot for Password-Encryption and MVN as Dependency-Manger.

All those Dependencies can be seen via Inspecting the **pom.xml**.

## Setting Up the App

At the current Version, the Application is set up by using the MainApplication.java
as the Starting Point, which holds the main() Function.

Use IntelliJ to set it as the Configuration starting Point,
by right-clicking it, selecting **'Run MainApplication.main()'**,
after you built the App via **'Build Project'**.
